Introduction
---

`therecipe/qt` is [Go](https://golang.org/) binding for [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) application framework which allows you to write GUI applications entirely in Go. This package supports almost all platform that supported by Qt, including Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, SailfishOS and Raspberry Pi.

The main target of this binding are :

1. easing the development of GUI application by making Qt's API accessible from Go; and
2. simplifying the development and deployment processes to multiple platforms.

Even though this binding is still work in progress, it's quite stable and most of Qt's API is already accessible from this binding, so it should already contain everything you need to build a fully featured applications. If you still missing something, feel free to open an issue.

Do note that there are no `godoc` entry for this package, because most of binding code is generated by [generator](https://github.com/therecipe/qt/tree/master/internal/binding). However, when building Qt app you can use official [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/classes.html) because almost every Qt's API is mapped by this binding to same or predictable name in Go.
